# 🧠 NLP Text Classification - Model Building

This project is dedicated to exploring the performance of various deep learning architectures on text classification tasks. The objective is to take raw text input, process it through a well-structured pipeline, and classify it accurately using modern neural network techniques. The models are trained on preprocessed datasets and evaluated using robust metrics to identify the most effective architecture for this natural language processing (NLP) problem.

## 🏗️ Model Architectures

We experimented with multiple sequential models that are well-suited for handling textual data:

### 1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are especially effective in NLP tasks where the context of a word within a sequence is crucial like in this problem.

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vector representations.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures temporal dependencies in sequences using memory cells.
- **Dropout Layer**: Reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
- **Dense Layer with Softmax Activation**: Outputs class probabilities.

LSTM is suitable when long-term context and order in the input text are important.

### 2. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
GRU is another variant of RNN, similar to LSTM but with fewer parameters and often faster to train. It combines the forget and input gates into a single update gate.

- **Embedding Layer**
- **GRU Layer**: Balances memory retention and computational efficiency.
- **Dropout Layer**
- **Dense Layer with Softmax**

GRU was evaluated as a lighter, more efficient alternative to LSTM.

### 3. **Simple RNN**
This is the most basic form of recurrent networks and serves as a baseline model.

- **Embedding Layer**
- **Simple RNN Layer**: Captures temporal patterns but has limitations like vanishing gradients on long sequences.
- **Dense Output Layer**

While less accurate than LSTM or GRU for complex patterns, it provides a comparative baseline to measure the benefit of advanced recurrent units.

### 4. **1D CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
Convolutional Neural Networks are traditionally used in computer vision, but 1D versions are effective in extracting n-gram-like features from text sequences.

- **Embedding Layer**
- **Conv1D Layer**: Applies filters to detect local patterns across word embeddings.
- **MaxPooling1D**: Downsamples feature maps.
- **Flatten + Dense Layers**: Combine and map features to output classes.

CNNs are computationally efficient and capture local word patterns, making them effective for shorter texts or when context is less critical.

##  Techniques Applied

### Preprocessing

To prepare the raw text for model input, a series of NLP preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of punctuation, special characters, digits, and unwanted symbols using regular expressions (`re` module).
- **Stopword Removal**: Using NLTK's English stopword list to filter out common but insignificant words.
- **Tokenization**: Mapping words to unique integer indices using `Tokenizer` from Keras.
- **Padding**: All sequences are padded to a fixed length using `pad_sequences` to ensure uniform input size.

This ensures consistency and compatibility with neural network input layers.

###  Dataset Handling

The project uses preprocessed datasets:

- **`train_prepro.csv`**: Contains the cleaned training data with labels.
- **`test_prepro.csv`**: Used for generating predictions for submission.

The training data is further split into:
- **Training Set (90%)**
- **Validation Set (10%)**

This allows for tuning model hyperparameters and evaluating generalization during training.

###  Training & Evaluation

To ensure robust training and prevent overfitting, the following strategies were applied:

- **EarlyStopping**: Halts training if the validation loss stops improving, saving computation time.
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces the learning rate if a plateau in validation loss is detected, helping the model escape local minima.
- **Categorical Crossentropy Loss**: Used for multi-class classification tasks.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-score** using `classification_report` from `sklearn`.

Each model is evaluated based on its validation performance to identify the best architecture.

###  Saving Models

Each trained model is saved in HDF5 format (`.h5`) to allow for easy reloading and deployment. Additionally:

- The **Tokenizer** object used for training is saved using Python's `pickle` module. This ensures consistency between training and inference stages by preserving the same word-to-index mapping.

### 📤 Submission

After the best-performing model is selected, predictions on the `test_prepro.csv` dataset are generated and saved in a submission-ready format (CSV).
